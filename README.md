# Tales of Time: RPG Management System

Welcome to the **Tales of Time** project. This is a Flask-based web application designed to manage characters, items, and quests for a tabletop RPG. This repository serves as your primary workspace for implementing a secure, relational Data Access Layer.

## 🛠 Technology Stack

* **Language:** Python 3.x
* **Web Framework:** Flask
* **Database:** SQLite 3
* **Data Access:** Raw SQL using the Repository Pattern

---

## 🚀 Getting Started

Follow these steps in sequence to set up your local development environment.

### 1. Clone the Repository
Open your terminal and run:
```bash
git clone [https://github.com/](https://github.com/)[YOUR-USERNAME]/talesoftime.git
cd talesoftime


2. Initialise the Database
This command creates the database skeleton and all 13 tables defined in your schema.

```bash
python -c "from models.models import init_db; init_db(); print('Database Skeleton Created Successfully!')"


3. Seed the Game Data
Populate your lookup tables and core entities with starting data to make the app functional.

```bash
python database/seed.py

4. Launch the Application
Start the Flask development server to view your project in the browser.

```bash
python app.py
Access the app at: http://127.0.0.1:5000

📝 Core Development Tasks
During this module, you are responsible for implementing the following architectural components:

Phase 1: Database Schema (database/schema.sql)
Define the relational structure using DDL SQL:

Lookup Tables: Static reference data for Classes, Species, Alignments, and Regions.

Core Entities: The main data for Characters, Items, and Quests.

Join Tables: Managing Many-to-Many relationships like Character Inventories and Quest history.

Phase 2: Connection Logic (models/models.py)
Configure the bridge between Python and SQLite:

get_db(): A connection factory that enforces PRAGMA foreign_keys = ON and uses sqlite3.Row for dictionary-style data access.

_SCHEMA: An internal DDL string that allows the application to self-heal and recreate missing tables.

Phase 3: Data Repositories (repositories/repositories.py)
Isolate complex SQL logic from the user interface:

Security: Using ? placeholders to prevent SQL Injection attacks.

Relational Logic: Writing explicit JOIN queries to retrieve human-readable names instead of raw IDs.

Business Logic: Implementing item-stacking logic in the InventoryRepository.

🛠 Useful Terminal Commands
Command	Purpose
git status	View modified files in your local workspace.
git add .	Stage all changes for the next snapshot.
git commit -m "msg"	Save a permanent version of your progress locally.
git push origin main	Sync your local commits with your GitHub fork.
CTRL + C	Safely stop the running Flask web server.
⚠️ Troubleshooting
Database Locked: Ensure you have closed any external database browser tools (like "DB Browser for SQLite") before running the app.

Foreign Key Errors: Occurs if you attempt to delete a row that is referenced elsewhere. Ensure ON DELETE CASCADE is set in your schema.

Missing Data: If your interface is empty, you likely skipped the python database/seed.py step.
